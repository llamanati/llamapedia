The basic idea is this:

1. Your primary interface with the world is third-hand knowledge gathering.
    1. First-hand: you experienced it yourself. For example in school, doing lab experiments is important to gain first-hand experience of key scientific principles. This is the best, surest way to learn. Your experience is your own.
    2. Second-hand: knowledge is relayed from someone who experienced it first-hand. Think reading an autobiography. This is the second-best way. Your experience has been transferred by someone who experienced it themselves.
    3. Third-hand: your knowledge is relayed from a second-hand source. Think basically every opinion news show. There are some interviews, but they're soundbite quality. I stop the relay counts here, but this includes any n-hand sources above second hand.
2. You primarily interact with the world via a network of worldview-affirming sources.
    1. If you don't challenge your worldview, you can't learn to ask [[the right questions|the right questions]] .
3. Every time you accept knowledge relayed by this network, you first stop using your critical thinking skills. Then you start accepting third-hand sources as first-hand sources.
    - The knowledge you received meshes with your existing first-person knowledge, so you are inclined to do a "fast review" of it, like a quick LGTM.
    - Eventually, you just auto-accept.
    - The problem is, [Resources/Philosophy/Thinking/CriticalThinking](https://publish.obsidian.md/ai6ua/Resources/Philosophy/Thinking/CriticalThinking) is a muscle, a fast decaying skill.

A filter bubble is functionally an [[echo chamber|echo chamber]]
